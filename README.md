# Hate Speech Detection on Instagram Comments

## Introduction

Social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, alongside the positive aspects of social media, the misuse of these platforms has led to a significant rise in hate speech and abusive comments. This behavior not only disrupts the online experience but can also cause psychological distress to individuals.

Instagram serves as a platform where users share personal moments and ideas through posts. The comment section fosters communication by allowing individuals to express their opinions, thoughts, and views. Unfortunately, some users exploit this space to spread hateful content, including vulgarity, demotivating remarks, and abusive language.

Recognizing this as a growing problem, we chose to focus on analyzing the text data from Instagramâ€™s comment sections to develop a hate speech detection system. This system will leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to identify and mitigate such harmful content.

## Problem Statement

- Hate speech on Instagram remains a significant problem, disrupting healthy communication and spreading negativity. Current solutions lack sufficient accuracy and adaptability, struggling to detect nuanced hate speech.
- This project addresses the challenge by developing a scalable hate speech detection model using ML and DL techniques, offering superior accuracy and real-time capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Deep Learning (DL)
